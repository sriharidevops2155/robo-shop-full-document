Environments: DEV, QA, SIT, UAT, PERF, PRE-PROD, PROD

SIT- System Integration Testing
PERF - Performance 

Linux --> Linus torvalds


windows
-----------
not open source
costly
not secure must install anti virus
slow
too many graphics
frequent restarts
tough to update/upgrade

Linux --> 9MB
Secure
high speed --> mostly text
no need of restarts
install or update packages is easy
free, community support
low resources"
	

DevOps is the process of building, deploying and testing the code written by developer on the same day instead of doing after complete development.. we can acheive this using continous integration, continous deployment, continous delivery and continous testing. 
We can do faster releases with less defect using DevOps... basically automation mindset to get the best results

DEV, QA, SIT, UAT, PERF, PRE-PROD, PROD

min 2, max any number

Linux --> Linus torvalds
=================
UNIX --> Hardware and Software(Unix OS) together
CPU, RAM, Hard Disk, OS(Software)
Laptop --> IBM BIOS

Linux --> from the sratch using C language based on unix principles. He invented git to store this

windows
-----------
not open source
costly
not secure must install anti virus
slow
too many graphics
frequent restarts
tough to update/upgrade

Linux --> 9MB
Secure

what is computer?
==================
IP enabled device

laptop == mobile == server == chip == tv ==> computer
server ==> only to host applications

RAM, OS, HD, Processor --> IP enabled device

Client Server architecture

Networking between computers

1. Network
2. Facebook application

serve --> lawyer serves to us, we are his client

facebook is in Linux server, if problem comes we need to login to server..

https://www.joindevops.com

Protocol: https
Port: 443
IP: DNS IP
Username and password --> authentication

SSH --> Secure shell
Port: 22
IP, Username and password/private-key

Firewall --> checks inbound and outbound traffic

inbound --> incoming traffic --> port number 22, 103.149.59.114
outbound --> outgoing traffic

authentication
==================
1. what you know --> username password
2. what you have --> keys, tokens, authentication, rsa token
3. what you are --> fingerprint, retina, palm, face

Server == box == node   - > In companies server is generally noted as box by everyone

lock = public
key = private

key pairs --> public key and private key


1. create key pair
2. create firewall
3. import public key to aws account
4. create server and attach public key
5. attach firewall to server

Git Bash --> Mini Linux in windows
SSH client 

browser --> http/https client
Linux Server --> SSH Server

git bash == putty == super putty == mobaxterm == mac terminal = windows cmd

ssh clients

pwd --> present working directory

User Directory
C:\Users\siva --> windows format
/c/Users/siva --> linux format

Windows accept space in file name -> Linux won't accept 

windows --> not case sensitive Siva == siva == Siva
Linux --> case sensitive --> Siva != siva no space in linux

/c/devops/daws-84s == C:\devops\daws-84s

ssh-keygen -f <file-name>

ssh-keygen -f daws-84s

ssh-rsa long-random-code Sri Hari. Bandi@DESKTOP-NSG82HF

Region --> us-east-1 - N.Virginia -> AWS is first created in US at N>virgina and hence using any service in this locations is cheaper in terms of cost 

0.0.0.0/0

98.81.70.98, 22, SSH, ec2-user, private-key

ssh -i <private-key> ec2-user@98.81.70.98

OS --> Redhat, Ubuntu, centos, fedore, suse, oracle linux, amazon linux, debian, rocky linux, kali, solaris

Linux is os or not --> Linux is kernel

OS --> to interact with hardware

Kernal --> heart and brain of OS

Kernel + UI == OS

Redhat --> kernel + user interface ==> Redhat OS
Debian --> Linux kernel + UI ==> Debian

99.9% same all Linux distros/flavours

Redhat --> Open source --> code is free
Redhat enterprise RHEL --> support

Current RHEL is OS version is 9 

RHEL = AWS Linux = Centos = Fedora = Rocky Linux = AlmaLinux

Linux is a kernal, RHEL is the distribution or Linux flavour 

Search for Linux Distributions in Linux in Google -> It will show all dirstibutions 


command <options> <inputs>


uname  -> Will show which kernal we are using -> FYI Amazon Linux bacially uses Linux Kernal

uname  -a . 

uname --help

will display all options avilable in uname command 

/home/ec2-user --> linux home directory
/c/users/siva --> windows home directory 

cd --> change directory

cd .. --> one step back

ls --> list subdirectories


drwx------. 3 ec2-user ec2-user  95 May  1 05:52 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root     root      22 May  1 05:46 ..
